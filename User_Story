Certainly! Here's how you might structure your stories to communicate your work to the Scrum Master:

1. **Story 1: Implement CSV Upload Feature**
   - As a user, I want to be able to upload a CSV file in the React application.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - There should be a file input field on the UI.
     - Upon selecting a file, the application should process the CSV file.
     - The processed data should be stored in the application state.

2. **Story 2: Analyze Metadata from CSV**
   - As a developer, I need to analyze the metadata from the uploaded CSV file.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Extract field names and data types from the CSV file.
     - Identify the types of UI components required based on the field types.
     - Provide metadata analysis for dynamic form generation.

3. **Story 3: Generate Dynamic UI Components**
   - As a developer, I need to dynamically generate UI components based on the metadata from the CSV file.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Generate input fields such as text fields, number fields, and dropdowns based on field types.
     - Ensure that the UI components reflect the metadata accurately.
     - Render the dynamic form on the UI for user interaction.

4. **Story 4: Integrate CSV Upload and Dynamic UI Components**
   - As a developer, I need to integrate the CSV upload feature with the dynamic UI component generation.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Upon uploading a CSV file, analyze its metadata and generate corresponding UI components.
     - Display the dynamic form on the UI with fields populated based on the CSV data.
     - Ensure that the form elements are interactive and responsive to user input.

Sure, here are some additional user stories to keep you occupied until May 20th:

5. **Story 5: Implement CSV Processing Backend**
   - As a developer, I need to implement backend functionality to process the uploaded CSV file.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Set up an API endpoint to receive and handle CSV file uploads.
     - Parse the CSV file and extract metadata on the backend.
     - Return the processed metadata to the frontend for dynamic form generation.

6. **Story 6: Error Handling for CSV Upload**
   - As a user, I want to receive clear error messages if there are issues with uploading or processing the CSV file.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Validate the uploaded file to ensure it is in CSV format.
     - Provide meaningful error messages for common issues such as invalid file format or empty files.
     - Display error messages prominently on the UI for easy understanding.

7. **Story 7: Enhance Dynamic Form Layout**
   - As a user, I want the dynamic form layout to be visually appealing and intuitive to use.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Improve the styling of the dynamic form components to enhance readability and usability.
     - Organize form elements logically with appropriate spacing and alignment.
     - Ensure consistency in design across different types of form fields.

8. **Story 8: Implement Dropdown Options from CSV Data**
   - As a developer, I need to populate dropdown options dynamically based on the data in the CSV file.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Identify fields in the CSV file that require dropdown selection.
     - Extract unique values for these fields to populate dropdown options.
     - Ensure that dropdown options are updated dynamically if the CSV data changes.

9. **Story 9: Unit Testing for CSV Processing**
   - As a developer, I need to write unit tests to ensure the accuracy of CSV processing functionality.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Write unit tests to cover various scenarios of CSV parsing and metadata extraction.
     - Mock CSV data for testing different edge cases and error conditions.
     - Ensure sufficient test coverage to catch potential bugs and regressions.

10. **Story 10: Integration Testing for CSV Upload Feature**
    - As a developer, I need to perform integration testing to validate the end-to-end functionality of the CSV upload feature.
    - Acceptance Criteria:
      - Set up integration tests to simulate user interactions with the file upload UI.
      - Test the entire CSV processing pipeline from frontend upload to backend metadata extraction.
      - Verify that the dynamic form is generated correctly based on the uploaded CSV data.
